== Header - End ==

== List0 - Begin <Text> ==

Formatting for list - ".domain.tld$" 
- Starting entry with . and ending with $ formats as a wildcard entry for every possible variation of the domain, including all subdomains.

Example:
.zymr.com$

== List0 - End ==

== List1 - Begin <Text> ==

- Wildcard formatting from <List0> not necessary - just format these entries as domain.tld
- Domains that show as components of a domain in <List0> should be added here. For example, if listing wp.com in <List0> then managewp.com will get flagged as well. 
- In this case add managewp.com to <List1> so it doesn't get flagged as well.

== List1 - End ==
